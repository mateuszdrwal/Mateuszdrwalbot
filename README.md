# Mateuszdrwalbot
a bot for lorgon's streams on twitch

https://www.twitch.tv/lorgon

Feel free to help me develop stuff

if you ever wonder why this bot has such obscure features, its because im treating this as a large practical coding practice and am trying as much different approaches as possible.

TODO:
- add !joke and !quote (classes alredy made)
- refactor data saving/loading system
- refactor heartbeat system
- refactor error detection
- make unit tests for commands
- docstrings in utilityFunctions.py
- fix systems for connecting to the bot (see start of client.py for details)
